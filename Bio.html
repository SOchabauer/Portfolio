Hey it’s Sophia Ochabauer (she/her)! I’m an Interdisciplinary 
Education in the Arts (IDEAs) student at UIChicago. I’m a 
multimedia artist, predominantly working with textiles and 
found treasures. My art is inspired by femininity, aversion to
traditionalism, Dayglo colors, and dead things. 
     
My art career began at three years old with the same heart-shaped
people over and over again. As I grew older, I was drawn to
arts and crafts. I unconsciously learned about different
materials and playing with new and exciting textures. At the
same time, I fell in love with the infallible nature of 
children’s art supplies. I hope to inspire others to learn
through play with my work. I hope to also encourage others to
embrace simple supplies to create.
