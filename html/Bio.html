Hey it’s Sophia Ochabauer (she/her)! I’m an Interdisciplinary 
Education in the Arts (IDEAs) student at UIChicago. I’m a 
multimedia artist, predominantly working with textiles and 
found treasures. My art is inspired by femininity, aversion to
traditionalism, Dayglo colors, and dead things. 
     
My art career began at 3 years old with the same heart-shaped
people over and over again. As I grew older, I was drawn to
arts and crafts. I unconsciously learned about different
materials and playing with new and exciting textures. At the
same time, I fell in love with the infallible nature of 
children’s art supplies. I hope to inspire others to learn
through play with my work. I hope to also encourage others to
embrace simple supplies to create.
