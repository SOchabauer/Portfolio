I have always wanted to print stupid things on <br>
panties, so I chose to use this idea for a <br>
class project! Yay! <br>
My friends will agree with me when I say I <br>
have no shame. I have chosen to hang my <br>
“shame” for all to see. Please ask me about my <br>
pelvic floor exercises. Please let me lament <br>
about my lost 2016 pinterest boards. Please let <br>
me tell you about the dead bug I found outside <br>
UPS. Please let me tell you about how badly I <br>
preserved it. Please let me tell you about how <br>
it kinda looks like it’s dancing, because its <br>
legs are all over the place. Please let me <br>
pour my shame out for you and I hope you do <br>
the same. <br>
<br>
...I’m wearing the wizard ones while writing <br>
this. 10/10 very comfy
